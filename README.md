# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?
- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")
- What problem does it solve?
- What did you learn?

My motivation for beginning this project was to gain experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git, and Github. It also doubles as a studying tool, as in my experience, much of my learning takes place while creating study resources. This website organizes the material, while simultaneously reinforcing my understanding of it. Overall, I learned a good amount of the process of creating a repository, creating files, deploying a website, and more.

## Usage

Each section of the website contains my accumulated notes on each topic. Opening the DevTools console will provide other features written in JavaScript that I built, such as a random study topic selector. Reading the notes, as well as experimenting the DevTools console will reinforce understanding of the material.
